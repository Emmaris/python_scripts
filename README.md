# python_scripts

galaxies.py is a script that will read in SED fitting data from FAST, quickly plot a few of the outputs, remove outliers, and then re-plot and determine the linear regression of SFR vs Mass.

Python_for_Data_Science_Project.py is a script I completed as part of a DataQuest course.  For the course, I compiled a profitable app profile for "developers" from app data for the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.  My goal for this project was to analyze data to help developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract the most users.

Python_for_Data_Science_Project_II.py is a script I completed as part of a DataQuest course.  For the course project, I analyzed online news postings for Hacker News, a site where user-submitted stories ("posts") are voted and commented upon.  I compared Show HN and Ask HN posts to determine which received more comments on average and if posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average.
